DESC = "Demonstrates how to preserve file inputs after form errors"
DOC = """
When using server-side error handling and validation with forms that include both primitive values and file inputs, the file inputâ€™s value is lost when the form returns with error messages. Consequently, users are required to re-upload the file, resulting in a less user-friendly experience.

To overcome the problem of losing file input value in simple cases, you can adopt the following approach:

Before:

::bad_form::

After:

::page submit my_form::

Form Restructuring: Move the binary file input outside the main form element in the HTML structure.

Using the form Attribute: Enhance the binary file input by adding the `form attribute` and setting its value to the ID of the main form. This linkage associates the binary file input with the form, even when it resides outside the form element.
