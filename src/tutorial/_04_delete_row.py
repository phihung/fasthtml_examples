This example shows how to implement a delete button that removes a table row upon completion. First letâ€™s look at the table body:
```python
Table(
    Thead(),
    Tbody(
        Tr(), Tr(), Tr(), Tr(),
        hx_confirm="Are you sure?",
        hx_target="closest tr",
        hx_swap="outerHTML swap:1s",
    )
)
```
The table body has a `hx-confirm` attribute to confirm the delete action. It also set the target to be the closest tr that is, the closest table row, for all the buttons (hx-target is inherited from parents in the DOM.) The swap specification in hx-swap says to swap the entire target out and to wait 1 second after receiving a response. This last bit is so that we can use the following CSS:
::css::
To fade the row out before it is swapped/removed.

Each row has a button with a hx-delete attribute containing the url on which to issue a DELETE request to delete the row from the server. This request responds with a 200 status code and empty content, indicating that the row should be replaced with nothing.
```python
Tr(
    Td("Angie MacDowell"),
    Td("angie@macdowell.org"),
    Td(Button("Delete", hx_delete="/contacts/1", cls="btn danger")),
)
```
